Conflicts with the naming is prevented this way and we can tell the interpreter exactly, which function or object to load into the memory when we use the prefix (e.g. *math.sin()*, *np.sin()* would be two differnt function calls, one to the function in package *math*, the other in the package *np*.)\n"
