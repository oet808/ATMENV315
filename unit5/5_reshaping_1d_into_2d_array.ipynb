    "Sometimes it is necessary to reorganize the data sample from 1 dimensional arrays into 2 or 3 dimensional arrays or the other way around.\n",

    "### 1.1 Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "(A) The [monthly index of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/correlation/nina34.data) is a time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "|year| Jan  | Feb   | Mar   | Apr   | May   | Jun   | Jul   | Aug   | Sep   | Oct   | Nov   | Dec |     |\n",

    "\n",
    "The data are arranged in a table with rows for the years and columns for the months. You want to plot the monthly mean time series and need to get your data from the 2-dimenionsal array into a 1-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) You have a 3-dimensional data set containing globally gridded 0.5 x 0.5 degree temperature data from the [ERA-Interim/Land](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim-land). Dimensions are longitude, latitude, and time. Multivariate statistical functions, however, often expect data to be arranged in rows for time dimension and columns are used to store all grid cells from the lon-lat dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(C) Some image file formats store their pixel information as a simple text file with RGB values using three columns or even one single column. In this case we need some information about the original dimension of the 2-dimensional image and the order in which the pixel information was stored in the file. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are several ways in Python's package numpy to reshape data arrays. We covered the basic methods using our learned tools. The function _np.reshape_ is a unverisal method to change the dimension of the data arrays. However, we must remember that there is a default rule how numpy fills the elements into the reshaped array.  \n",

    "Together with index selection /slicing operations that allow us to extract subsamples from our data arrays, the function np.reshape is giving you more flexibility in working with data sets, such as data from spreadsheet table files. \n",

    "__Tip__: If your future research takes you into data analysis you may want to expand your 'tools': the package _pandas_ and _xarray_ are really powerful support packages for data analysis in Python."
